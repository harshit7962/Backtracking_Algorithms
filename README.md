# Backtracking_Algorithms
Backtracking is a technique based algorithm which uses recursive calling to find the solution by building a solution step by step increaseing values with time. It removes the undesirable solutions of the problems based on the constraints at place and tries to minimise the number of recursive calls by eliminating them as soon as they are encountered in our current result set...
